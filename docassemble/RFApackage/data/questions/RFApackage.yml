#People can use https://apps-dev.suffolklitlab.org/start/RFA_Demo/ to test my demo -- and I can keep working on this RFApackage. Then I can "update" the RFA "Package". That will update the RFADemo interview. (Go to Package Management in the login dropdown menu.)

####################### TO DO #######################
#####FOR LEMMA TO WORK ON #####
#Please do not edit the PDF templates. I have worked on them for accessibility. I can edit them if needed :)
#Work on getting all answers to show correctly on PDFs.
#Clean up the Review answers screen. It's missing some fields/variables. If you add the missing ones, Kris could reorganize them in the general order of the interview.
#Customize address questions so people type in Apt. or Unit before their #. I want to print address on one line sometimes and all I see now is C instead of Apt. C. (On Conf. Notification PDF, to full physical address on Complaint at top and at #5 on first page, to top of Affidavit)
#For id: Relationship to defendant, require only one answer
#For id: What you want to ask for in the RFA order, require at least one checkmark
#For id: What you want to ask for in the RFA order, make subquestions required
#For id: Existing orders or court proceedings, only show the bottom questions if the user has checked one of the checkboxes
#How change line spacing for multi-line narrative answers in affidavit PDF?
#On Affidavit, I tried to format time better like format_time("04:01:23", format='h:mm a')  but it gives an error message on the PDF
#For extra sheet of weapons, how do I do   if extra_sheet_weapons:   then set  extra_sheets_attached = 1
# Also need to add weapons_overflow  as an overflow attachment
#In interview, why does this page show? id: preview RFApackage  before the page where they can view forms and hit edit button? Do I need that?
#In interview, trial_court_address.address and .county was triggering the baked-in What court do you want to file in screen. I ask a simple county question instead. But for efiling we should probably set up VT Courts list properly, right?
#I'd like to offer a "Edit your answers" link in the upper-right dropdown menu (the account dropdown menu options). It should go to the review screen.
#I currently have NOT customized our Next Steps document. It's a static file. The one thing we could do is to add the address, phone and email for the county family court that they selected.

#####END LEMMA ##########

#####KRIS TO WORK ON########
#Ask Laura: What if user doesn't know Def birthdate or address?
#Why is background black when I look at this in Chrome on Android phone?
#Update variable names in Edit and Publish sections for all the ones that I did checkboxes for, including:  skin color   hair length   hair_color  eye color - choose one
#Other places the defendant might be, Use state abbreviations and default to VT
#Re-do complaint PDF so it's a smaller size document? Should check marks look larger on PDF?
#In footer, add vtcourt forms are offered by LSV?

question: |
  What to know before you start
subquestion: |
  Some important things to know about asking the court for a Relief from Abuse order (RFA) in Vermont:
  
  * There is no charge for an RFA order. It is free. 
  * **Even when the courts are closed, it’s after hours, or it’s a weekend or holiday, you can start a Relief from Abuse case.** You may be able to get a temporary order right away to help keep you safe. At these times, you can email these forms or simply call and ask for help. Call the Vermont courts’ answering service at 1-800-540-9990. Say that you need help applying for a Relief from Abuse order over the phone. If you call, you need to leave a message with a number where they can call you back within an hour.
  * Applying for an RFA order can be a very dangerous time. Work with an advocate from the [Vermont Network](https://www.vtnetwork.org/get-help/) to create a safety plan — whether you end up asking for an RFA or not.
  * For details on the whole RFA process, visit the [RFA Roadmap on the VTLawHelp.org website.](https://vtlawhelp.org/roadmap/relief-from-abuse/step-1)

  About using this guided interview
subquestion: |  
  * Make sure you are in a safe place. It takes time to work through this interview. It may take 1 hour or more.
  * If you are in danger right now, dial 911.
  * Use this interview if you are asking for an RFA order for you, **or** both you and your children. (There are different forms for [asking for an RFA only on behalf of a child or children.](https://vtlawhelp.org/roadmap/relief-from-abuse/step-3))
  * The forms in this interview can only be used in Vermont.
  * Consider creating an account and saving your work along the way. You could log in later to review your answers with an advocate. Choose “sign up” in the menu above, or “register” below.
  * Click "Share" at the bottom of this page to share a link to your progress with someone you trust. Important: The person you share this link with will be able to see and edit your answers.
  <h3 class="h4">Information you will need</h3>
  * To complete this interview, you will need to know the date or dates when the abuse occurred and give a detailed description of the abuse. This includes the most recent incident and the most serious incident. You will need to fully describe the incidents and make it clear how severe or how frequent the abuse has been.
  * You will need to give a safe address and telephone number where the court can reach you. If you don’t have one, ask an advocate from the [Vermont Network.](https://www.vtnetwork.org/get-help/)
  * You will see important questions about weapons that the defendant might have access to. If you list what they are and where they are located, the court can order law enforcement to collect them to help keep you safe.
  <h3 class="h4">After answering the questions</h3>
  * At the end you will get a chance to preview your forms and make changes if you need to. 
  * Then you can download, print and/or save a PDF of your completed forms.
  * You will also get an instruction sheet about how to get the completed forms to the court – this includes emailing them or dropping them off at your local family court.
  
  Next, let’s make sure this is the right interview for your situation.
