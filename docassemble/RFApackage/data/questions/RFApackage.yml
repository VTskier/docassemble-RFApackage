  What to know before you start
subquestion: |
  Some important things to know about asking the court for a Relief from Abuse order (RFA) in Vermont:
  
  * There is no charge for an RFA order. It is free. 
  * **Even when the courts are closed, it’s after hours, or it’s a weekend or holiday, you can start a Relief from Abuse case.** You may be able to get a temporary order right away to help keep you safe. At these times, you can email these forms or simply call and ask for help. Call the Vermont courts’ answering service at 1-800-540-9990. Say that you need help applying for a Relief from Abuse order over the phone. If you call, you need to leave a message with a number where they can call you back within an hour.
  * Applying for an RFA order can be a very dangerous time. Work with an advocate from the [Vermont Network](https://www.vtnetwork.org/get-help/) to create a safety plan — whether you end up asking for an RFA or not.
  * For details on the whole RFA process, visit the [RFA Roadmap on the VTLawHelp.org website.](https://vtlawhelp.org/roadmap/relief-from-abuse/step-1)

  About using this guided interview
subquestion: |  
  * Make sure you are in a safe place. It takes time to work through this interview. It may take 1 hour or more.
  * If you are in danger right now, dial 911.
  * Use this interview if you are asking for an RFA order for you, **or** both you and your children. (There are different forms for [asking for an RFA only on behalf of a child or children.](https://vtlawhelp.org/roadmap/relief-from-abuse/step-3))
  * The forms in this interview can only be used in Vermont courts.
  * Consider creating an account and saving your work along the way. You could log in later to review your answers with an advocate. Choose “sign up” in the menu above, or “register” below.
  * Click "Share" at the bottom of this page to share a link to your progress with someone you trust. Important: The person you share this link with will be able to see AND change your answers.
  <h3 class="h4">Information you will need</h3>
  * To complete this interview, you will need to know the date or dates when the abuse occurred and give a detailed description of the abuse. This includes the most recent incident and the most serious incident. You will need to fully describe the incidents and make it clear how severe or how frequent the abuse has been.
  * You will need to give a safe address and telephone number where the court can reach you. If you don’t have one, ask an advocate from the [Vermont Network.](https://www.vtnetwork.org/get-help/)
  * You will need either a home address or work address for the "defendant" -- the person who is doing the abuse.
  * You will see important questions about weapons that the defendant might have access to. If you list what they are and where they are located, the court can order law enforcement to collect them to help keep you safe.
  <h3 class="h4">After answering the questions</h3>
  * At the end you will get a chance to preview your forms and make changes if you need to. 
  * Then you can download, print and/or save a PDF of your completed forms.
  * You will also get an instruction sheet about how to get the completed forms to the court – this includes emailing them or dropping them off at your local family court.
  
  Next, let’s make sure this is the right interview for your situation.
